## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete ROS 2 Environment Setup (Priority: P1)

As an advanced undergraduate student with Python and ML background, I want to set up a complete ROS 2 development environment on Ubuntu 22.04 so that I can start learning and working with humanoid robotics.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational requirement that enables all other learning activities in the book. Without a proper environment, students cannot execute any of the examples or complete hands-on exercises.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully completing the installation process and running a basic ROS 2 "Hello World" example (publisher/subscriber nodes) with no errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installation, **When** I follow the setup instructions in the book, **Then** I have a complete ROS 2 Humble/Iron environment with Isaac packages installed and verified.
2. **Given** I have completed the setup, **When** I run the basic ROS 2 example, **Then** the publisher and subscriber nodes communicate successfully without errors.

### User Story 2 - Build Physics-Accurate Robot Simulations (Priority: P2)

As a graduate student interested in robotics and embodied AI, I want to create physics-accurate robot simulations in Gazebo and Unity so that I can test my robotics algorithms in realistic environments before deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is a core capability that differentiates the book from purely theoretical approaches. Simulation is essential for testing robotics algorithms safely and cost-effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully creating a custom world in Gazebo with obstacles, spawning a robot model, and visualizing sensors working correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a completed ROS 2 environment, **When** I follow the simulation setup instructions, **Then** I can successfully spawn a humanoid robot in a custom Gazebo world with physics properties.
2. **Given** a simulated robot, **When** I run sensor visualization tools, **Then** I can see accurate sensor data (LIDAR, camera, IMU) being generated by the simulated robot.

### User Story 3 - Implement Navigation and Perception Systems (Priority: P3)

As a professional transitioning into robotics/AI, I want to implement VSLAM and navigation pipelines using Isaac ROS so that I can understand how robots perceive and navigate in real-world environments.

**Why this priority**: This covers the practical application of robotics concepts that are essential for autonomous robot operation, building on the simulation foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully running a VSLAM pipeline that maps an environment and enables autonomous navigation to specified waypoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a robot in a Gazebo environment, **When** I launch the VSLAM pipeline, **Then** the robot successfully builds a map of the environment and localizes itself within it.
2. **Given** a robot with a map, **When** I send navigation goals, **Then** the robot successfully plans and executes paths to reach the specified waypoints.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the simulation environment is too complex for the hardware (resource constraints)?
- How does the system handle robot kinematic limits during motion planning?
- What if the robot encounters obstacles not present in the training environment?
- How does the system behave when sensor data is noisy or incomplete?
