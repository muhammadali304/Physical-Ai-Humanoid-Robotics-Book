# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational book on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This curriculum is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students with a background in Python and machine learning fundamentals who want to explore the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers a complete 13-week curriculum that takes you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations:

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**: Introduction to Physical AI concepts and environment setup
2. **Core Skills (Weeks 3-7)**: ROS 2 fundamentals, simulation with Gazebo, and robot modeling
3. **Advanced AI Integration (Weeks 8-10)**: NVIDIA Isaac platform, perception, and navigation
4. **Intelligence Layer (Weeks 11-13)**: Vision-Language-Action systems and LLM integration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:

- Proficiency in Python programming
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure a complete ROS 2 development environment
- Create physics-accurate robot simulations in Gazebo
- Implement VSLAM and navigation pipelines using Isaac ROS
- Integrate LLMs for voice-controlled robot actions
- Deploy AI models from simulation to real hardware
- Complete a capstone project integrating all learned concepts

## Chapter Structure

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Learning Objectives** - What you'll achieve
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need to know beforehand
3. **Conceptual Overview** - Theoretical foundations
4. **Hands-On Implementation** - Practical exercises
5. **Testing & Verification** - How to confirm success
6. **Common Issues** - Solutions to frequent problems
7. **Key Takeaways** - Summary of important points
8. **Next Steps** - Preview of upcoming content

## Hardware Options

This book provides guidance for three hardware tiers:

- **Simulation-only**: Perfect for learning without hardware investment
- **Budget Tier** (~$700): TurtleBot 4 or similar for hands-on experience
- **Standard Tier** (~$3K): Quadruped robots for advanced projects
- **Premium Tier** (~$16K+): Full humanoid robots for complete experience

## Getting Started

Begin with the next chapter where you'll set up your Ubuntu 22.04 environment and install ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill. This foundational setup is essential for all subsequent learning activities.

Let's embark on this exciting journey into Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
